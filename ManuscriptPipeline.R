#This script runs through the DTW and Clustering Pipeline Utilized in

#Here you will find 4 primary sections. Note that these must be run sequentially
#in order for them to function.

#1. Generation of a simulated dataset with three distinct groups of patients
#   based on their Fearon Consensus Criteria Levels

#2. Comparison of our DTW algorithm versus a previously published R package 
#   To ensure there were no errors in DTW development

#3. Clustering of patients using the K-Medoids Algorithm (Paritioning Around Medoids)
#   based on their DTW distance.

#4. Visualization of the clusters over pseudotime

#We developed our own implementation of DTW to allow for the use of
